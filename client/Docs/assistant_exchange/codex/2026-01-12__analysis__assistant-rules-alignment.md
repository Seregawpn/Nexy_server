# Task
Assess alignment between .cursorrules and AGENTS.md and suggest minimal centralization.

# Findings
- .cursorrules contains extensive rules and references Docs/* that appear missing in this workspace.
- AGENTS.md is minimal and does not reference .cursorrules or clarify precedence.

# Recommendation
- Add a short precedence note and canonical sources link to avoid duplication/conflict.
